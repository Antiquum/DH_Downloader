DH Downloader
=============

A simple Delphi program to download files with the following options:<br>

[+] You can change the name of the downloaded file<br>
[+] Can be stored in the folder you want<br>
[+] You can hide the file<br>
[+] Makes the file is started each time you load Windows<br>
[+] Can I charge hidden or normal<br>
[+] I also made a generator that is intended to put a direct download link like dropbox to download a server where you can also change the icon.<br>
